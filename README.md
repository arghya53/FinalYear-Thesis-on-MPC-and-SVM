# FinalYear-Thesis-on-MPC-and-SVM
In this thesis report we had applied two different control techniques Model
Predictive Control (MPC) ,and Space Vector Modulation (SVM) on Neutral
Point Clamped (NPC) Inverter for induction motor and observed the response
of the inverter for each of these control algorithms. In case of MPC, an arbi-
trarily chosen constant will be selected for the optimization of cost function
instead of going through any algorithmic approach. On the other hand, a
simplified algorithm will be followed for allocating reference vector in differ-
ent regions of space for SVM to minimize calculation complexities. 
We have applied MATLAB and SIMULINK to model this comparative analysis.
